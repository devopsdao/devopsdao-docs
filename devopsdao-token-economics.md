# Devopsdao Token Economics


# Introduction & Overview

DevopsDAO is a decentralised and permissionless marketplace for finding and hiring tech talents and designers. We have started building devopsdao with the crypto and blockchain developer commmunity in our minds, but coming close to a near launch ready version of our dApp we are thinking of "why not for all tech talents and designers?" why should we limit us folks? Let's do a deeper dive into how the marketplace works.

## Marketplace on devopsdao

The marketplace is the central place of our dApp where almost everything happens. Users of the dApp are generally catgorized in two main groups "customers" and "performers", performers are developers, designers, etc. users perfoming tasks and completing tasks. Some of the performers can become auditors depending on their level of skills, depth of domain knowledge and contribution to the DAO.

## Assets of devopsdao

devopsdao assets are categorized in two categories:

a. Token (fungible)
b. NFT (non-fungible)

These two main assets will be used either alone or in combination. NFTs will have multiple use cases. First and most important use case of a NFT is the user's profile; Users will mint their profile NFTs paying with devopsdao token. Users' profile NFTs will be accumulating the users activity on the platform, some of the metrics are:

- Tasks added to marketplace
- Tasks completed successfully (based on time, quality and cost)
- Technical skills
- Number of clients worked for

## Token (fungible)

devopsdao token can be used as gas, this depends on user's choice. Fees will be paid and collected in devopsdao token. Token will be needed to buy "skill tags", NFTs and pay for audits.

## NFTs (non-fungible)

NFTs will have various use cases on devopsdao.

* user profiles will be NFTs
* every task is actually a NFT


## Task tags and NFTs tags

1. Each task can be created with a number of text tags assigned to it along its title and description.

When a Customer assigns a common tag which is also available as preminted NFT tags collection (for example Javascript, Design or Web3), user is able to attach one to his task. Such option is available by clicking on the assigned tag and selecting a count of NFT tags to be attached to the task, if a Customer does not have any NFT tags from the collection he is able to mint it for a fee, or buy from a Market(do be defined separately).

When the task is created, the NFT tags assigned to the task are transferred from Customer wallet to the task contract address.

2. When a Performer applies to the task with NFT tags he must own at least the same amount of the NFT tags of the particular collection. If a Performer owns more NFT tags than was assigned to a task he can boost his participation by using more NFT tags so he will be shown higher and a power bar(and probably tag count) will be shown on his NFT tag badge. When Performer applies to the task, the NFT tags in the specified amount are transferred from Performers wallet to the task contract address.

3. When Performer completes the task he receives all NFT tags assigned to the task, both Customers' and his own. He is free to keep it or sell on the Market.

# Audits

Both the customer and performer can initiate an audit; Audits are used for settling an issue, mediation and clarification if there are any misunderstandings or unclear topics between the customer and the performer about the work done.

## when can users initate an audit?

* When a task is in Agreed, Progress, Review stage Customer can apply for an Audit.
* When a task is in a Review stage a Performer can apply for an Audit.

2.5 % audit fee is paid by topping up the task contract during the application. 

When a task is sent to Audit, it is available for Auditors to apply for it, then the Initiator of the audit can select the Auditor. The performer must own a Auditor NFT to qualify. Auditor NFTs are earned and can not be bought in the marketplace.

When an Auditor is selected he carefully reviews the task and asks the Performer to send him his work, the Auditor must analyze if the work matches the tasks requirements and within 48 hours make his decision either to: set the task to a Completed stage, or return it back to the New stage for a new performer selection.

When the work does not match the task requirements, Auditor based on on his professional expertise has a right to ask the Performer to send his corrections if he believes that it is minor and the work can be improved within the Audit period.

Auditor role is to effectively and economically resolve the issue raised between the Customer and Performer, for which he gets 10% Audit fee.
