Devopsdao is a community driven project to build an ecosystem of blockchain software development, as a part 
of our community contribution effort we have took the development of webthree library (a fork of web3dart) 
in order to keep Dart language ecosystem consistent with the recent updates of Ethereum network.

# WebThree

WebThree â€” a web3 library for dart that allows you to interact with a local or remote ethereum node using HTTP or WebSocket. Suports custom credentials providers like WalletConnect and Metamask.

Fork of original web3dart 2.3.5 by simolus3, incorporating all changes from other forks.

# Features

Connect to an Ethereum node with the rpc-api, call common methods
Send signed Ethereum transactions
Generate private keys, setup new Ethereum addresses
Call functions on smart contracts and listen for contract events
Code generation based on smart contract ABI for easier interaction

# 2.5.0 first WebThree version

Renaming library to WebThree in order to maintain a community developed fork.
Bumping version number to 2.5.0, pull requests are greatly appreciated. No breaking changes were made.

the reason for creating this fork from https://github.com/simulous/web3dart 2.3.5 was that web3dart 2.4.1 currently published at https://pub.dev/packages/web3dart/ Github repo https://github.com/xclud/web3dart has factored out contract generator and metamask integration, making a breaking change. The following changes were implemented:

1. added stubs for dart_wrappers.dart and dart:js, added conditional dependencies import to metamask example in order to support web and other platform builds from a single codebase.

2. fix signPersonalMessage to use modern personal_sign instead of eth_sign

3. fix type issues in getTransactionHistory

4. Merged all reasonamble commits from the forks network, 
thank you @@simolus3 @superkeka @alexeyinkin @xclud @TheGreatAxios @rgplvr @thegamenicorus @MahmoudKhalid @superkeka from @superkeka/web3dart

5. Make EthereumAddress Comparable

6. StateMutability error when parsing json abi that contains an event simolus3/web3dart#13

7. Make getTransactionByHash nullable

8. Expose number utility functions simolus3/web3dart#3

9. decodeCall Uses the known types of the function parameters to parse them from the binary call data. The reverse of [encodeCall].
