# Devopsdao processes

## Audit process:

When a task is in Agreed, Progress, Review stage Customer can apply for an Audit. When a task is in a Review stage a Performer can apply for an Audit. A 10% audit fee is paid by topping up the task contract during the application.

When a task is sent to Audit, it is available for Auditors to apply for it, then the Initiator of the audit can select the Auditor(note: maybe we will make it random). When an Auditor is selected he carefully reviews the task and asks the Performer to send him his work, the Auditor must analyze if the work matches the tasks requirements and within 48 hours make his decision either to: set the task to a Completed stage, or return it back to the New stage for a new performer selection. When the work does not match the task requirements, Auditor based on on his professional expertise has a right to ask the Performer to send his corrections if he believes that it is minor and the work can be improved within the Audit period. Auditor role is to effectively and economically resolve the issue raised between the Customer and Performer, for which he gets 10% Audit fee.
