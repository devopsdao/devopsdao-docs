# Introduction

We envision to cultivate an equal DAO, menaing all DAO members have equal voting power, one member = one vote. However depending on the user's contribution to the DAO, the user will be able to boost his voting power.

Each member has equal rights to raise a proposal.

Every proposal will be discussed within the DAO and will be voted. The result of the vote will decide if the proposal will be taken forward.

Every proposal can only be brought one time to the DAO for discussion and voting, if a proposal was initially rejected, even did not proceed to voting, this proposal can not be submitted in its initial status and must be updated according to feedback and input received by the community.
