# Introduction

We envision to cultivate an equal DAO, menaing all DAO members have equal voting power, one member = one vote. However depending on the user's contribution to the DAO, the user will be able to boost his voting power.

Each member has equal rights to raise a proposal.

Every proposal will be discussed within the DAO and will be voted. The result of the vote will decide if the proposal will be taken forward.

Every proposal can only be brought one time to the DAO for discussion and voting, if a proposal was initially rejected, even did not proceed to voting, this proposal can not be submitted in its initial status and must be updated according to feedback and input received by the community.

# Simple process for proposals

1. user drafts a proposal
2. user submits proposal to DAO forum
3. at DAO forum the proposal is discussed
4. for any proposal to pass onto voting, DAO participation must be above 70%
5. when threshold is achieved, the proposal will be voted onto the next stage
6. at the next stage the proposal will be evaluated deeply, technical impacts, economic impacts, any concerns will be clearly stated.
7. when due dilligence is passed, then the proposal will go onto execution voting
8. at this stage DAO community will be voting on the execution of the proposal
9. for any proposal to pass execution approval, DAO participatio must exceed 80%
10. the vote result will be executed

# Simple process for disputes

any disputes will be examined carefully by all DAO members; disputes will be openly discussed as long as they are not intended for a closed group. Closed groups are entitled to manage their issues witin their community; However closed groups can not use their collective power to manipulate DAO general matters. Every member owns one vote. Closed groups do not have an extra combined or accumulated power.

1. a dispute is raised at the dispute board
2. every dispute must be clearly explained, both parties are encouraged to maintain a professional language
3. every dispute will be audited carefully by the DAO
4. every dispute will be examined carefully by the DAO
5. if necessary subject matter experts can be involved through standard dodao processes

# simple process to follow when implementing changes on dodao.dev

1. our ultimate responsibility is business continuity
2. we will check every aspect of the change very carefully
3. we will evaulate technical impact
4. we will evaluate business impact
5. ideally the technical and business impact of the proposed change weigh equally important
6. balancing technical benefits and business benefits shall be our constant aim
7. before we implement a change will do a risk assesment and take measures to mitigate any risk
8. we will clearly define a change implementation plan and follow it during the change
9. we will clearly define a test procedure and follow it during and after the change
10. acceptance criteria of any change will be clearly and undoubtedly defined before the change is implemented
11. every change must be approved at the CAB (Change Advisory Board)
12. every change will be documented without any doubt
