Arweave, Axelar, Dart, Flutter, Moonbeam, Solidity, Walletconnect, Ethereum EIP-2535 Diamonds, EIP-1155 multi token contracts.

Devopsdao dApp is built on Flutter 2 powered by Dart language. Framework optimized for fast native apps on any platform. 

Devopsdao is a early bird blockchain project based on Flutter 2, taking the advantage to be presented on major platforms. Devopsdao EIP-2539 based smart contract Diamonds are compiled with hardhat and depend on Axelar GMP SDK for cross-chain interoperability. Devopsdao web app is served from Arweave decentralized cloud.

Implemented Axelar, Hyperlane, Layerzero and Wormhole smart contacts as Diamond facets to enable cross-chain features.

devopsdao dApp is deployed on Moonbase-alpha and is available via Axelar GMP from Axelar supported blockchains. It is also available via Hyperlane, Wormhole and LayerZero bridges.

For Web3 interaction we support our own WebThree library.
