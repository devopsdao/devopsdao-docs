# Devopsdao Token Economics


## Introduction

DevopsDAO is a decentralised and permissionless marketplace for finding and hiring tech talents and designers. We have started building devopsdao with the crypto and blockchain developer commmunity in our minds, but coming close to a near launch ready version of our dApp we are thinking of "why not for all tech talents and designers?" why should we limit us folks? Let's do a deeper dive into how the marketplace works.

## Marketplace on devopsdao

The marketplace is the central place of our dApp where almost everything happens. Users of the dApp are generally catgorized in two main groups "customers" and "performers", performers are developers, designers, etc. users perfoming tasks and completing tasks. Some of the performers can become auditors depending on their level of skills, depth of domain knowledge and contribution to the DAO.

## Assets of devopsdao

devopsdao assets are categorized in two categories:

a. Token (fungible)
b. NFT (non-fungible)

These two main assets will be used either alone or in combination. NFTs will have multiple use cases. First and most important use case of a NFT is the user's profile; Users will mint their profile NFTs paying with devopsdao token. Users' profile NFTs will be accumulating the users activity on the platform, some of the metrics are:

- Tasks added to marketplace
- Tasks completed successfully (based on time, quality and cost)
- Technical skills
- Number of clients worked for

## Token (fungible)

devopsdao token can be used as gas, this depends on user's choice. Fees will be paid and collected in devopsdao token. Token will be needed to buy "skill tags", NFTs and pay for audits.
